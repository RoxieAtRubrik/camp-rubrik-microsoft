# Objective: Create and Apply an SLA Domain

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Walkthrough the Rubrik UI
* Gain familiarity with the Rubrik Dashboard
* Create and apply an SLA Domain

The Rubrik Cloud Data Management \(RCDM\) platform is a software-defined system that distributes data, metadata, and tasks across the Rubrik cluster and public cloud for linear scalability and performance.

## Getting Started

Once racked, the Rubrik system setup is easily and quickly completed in under an hour for virtual and physical environments. RCDM uses multicast DNS to automatically discover and self-configure each of the nodes within the cluster. The user assigns IP addresses to each of the nodes and login credentials for the environment to be managed by Rubrik. To expand cluster size, the user simply assigns new IP addresses through the management dashboard. To reduce cluster size, the user selects the nodes to remove. Thereafter, the cluster automatically self-adjusts and re-balances to deliver fault tolerance against node and disk failures.
